Overview
Fraud detection is a critical application of machine learning aimed at preventing financial losses and ensuring data security. This project:

Explores a dataset to uncover patterns.
Builds predictive models for identifying fraudulent transactions.
Visualizes results and evaluates model performance.
Features
The project includes:

Data cleaning and preprocessing.
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations.
Supervised machine learning models for classification.
Model evaluation with performance metrics.
Dataset
The dataset is loaded from a CSV file named dar.csv. It includes transaction-level data with features indicative of potential fraud.

Example Features:
Transaction Amount: The monetary value of the transaction.
Timestamp: When the transaction occurred.
Location: Transaction location data.
Fraudulent: Target variable indicating if the transaction was fraudulent.
Installation
Prerequisites
Python 3.x
Required libraries: pandas, numpy, seaborn, matplotlib, scikit-learn
Steps
Clone this repository:
bash
Copy code
git clone https://github.com/your-username/fraud-detection-system.git
cd fraud-detection-system
Install dependencies:
bash
Copy code
pip install -r requirements.txt
Usage
Data Exploration and Preprocessing:

Clean and preprocess the dataset for missing values, outliers, and normalization.
Model Training:

Train the machine learning model on the preprocessed dataset using the script:
bash
Copy code
python train_model.py
Fraud Prediction:

Use the trained model to predict fraudulent transactions:
bash
Copy code
python predict.py --input new_data.csv
Model and Approach
EDA:

Visualize data distributions and correlations using Seaborn and Matplotlib.
Identify key fraud indicators.
Preprocessing:

Normalize continuous features.
Encode categorical variables for model compatibility.
Models:

Random Forest
Gradient Boosting
Logistic Regression
Evaluation Metrics:

Accuracy
Precision, Recall, and F1 Score
ROC-AUC
Results
Achieved high accuracy and recall in identifying fraudulent transactions.
Visualized fraud patterns to assist in manual auditing processes.
Note: Model performance may vary based on dataset quality and feature engineering.
